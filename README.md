## About
I created a function called **quick_stats()** that calculates several summary statistics for all numeric variables in a data frame, including:
 * Mean
 * Standard Deviation
 * Median
 * Mode
 * Range

The function can also handle missing values and non-numeric vectors. 

## How to use
* The [R markdown](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2024/assignment-b1-maddyriddler/blob/main/assignment-b10-mriddler.Rmd) and [markdown version](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2024/assignment-b1-maddyriddler/blob/main/assignment-b10-mriddler.md) include the raw code for the function along with roxygen2 documentation for a more detailed explanation.
* The same documents include examples of how to use my function and formal tests to ensure the code functions properly when it encounters non-redundant inputs.
